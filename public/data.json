This guide walks you through the step-by-step process to successfully log in to the Arivix system using either a web browser or a mobile device.\n\n---\n\n## 🔐 Step 1: Navigate to the Login Page\n\nOpen your preferred browser and go to the official Arivix login URL:\n\n👉 [https://app.arivix.ai/login](https://app.arivix.ai/login)\n\nIf you are using a custom enterprise domain (e.g., yourcompany.arivix.ai), make sure to visit the correct subdomain as provided by your admin.\n\n\n---\n\n## 🧑\u200d💼 Step 2: Enter Your Credentials\n\nOnce on the login screen, you will see two fields:\n\n- *Email Address: Enter the email associated with your Arivix account.\n- **Password*: Type your password carefully. Arivix uses strong encryption for user protection, but incorrect attempts may lead to lockouts.\n\n> 💡 Tip: Use a password manager to auto-fill your credentials if you forget them.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 Step 3: Use SSO or Social Login (Optional)\n\nIf your organization has enabled Single Sign-On (SSO) using Google, Microsoft, or other identity providers, you will see buttons like:\n\n- Sign in with Google\n- Sign in with Microsoft\n- Continue with SSO\n\nClick the appropriate option and follow the OAuth2 flow to log in securely.\n\n> 📢 Note: If you don't see these options, your organization may not have enabled SSO.\n\n---\n\n## 🛡 Step 4: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)\n\nIf 2FA is enabled on your account, you’ll be prompted to enter a verification code sent via:\n\n- *Email\n- **SMS\n- **Authenticator App* (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy)\n\nOnce the 6-digit code is entered, click Verify to proceed.\n\n> 🔐 Don’t share your 2FA code with anyone—even Arivix support.\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Step 5: Dashboard Access\n\nAfter successful login, you’ll be redirected to the Arivix Dashboard. This is your control center where you can:\n\n- View and manage AI Agents\n- Configure tool integrations (e.g., Slack, Notion, Google Calendar)\n- Monitor logs and analytics\n- Access Knowledge Bases and Workspaces\n- Invite other users or manage your organization settings\n\n> 📊 Your role (Super Admin, Admin, or Contributor) will determine which modules you can access.\n\n---\n\n## ❓ Troubleshooting Login Issues\n\nHere are some common login problems and how to resolve them:\n\n| Issue                        | Solution                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Forgot Password             | Click on Forgot Password on the login page and follow the reset steps.|\n| Email not recognized        | Ensure you’re using the correct email or contact your workspace admin.  |\n| 2FA code not received       | Check spam folders or use a backup method if available.                 |\n| Account Locked              | Too many failed attempts?
